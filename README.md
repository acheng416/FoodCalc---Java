# FoodCalc---Java
## Implements DualSimplex and Simplex methods to recommend ideal quantities of each food given based upon given macronutrient constraints.


###### Idea:

###### Features:
  * Parses data from USDA website for over 8,000 food items and their nutritional content
  * Implements Simplex method
  * Implements DualSimplex method
  * Adds artificial and slack variables when necessary
  * Allows the addition of constraint equations (feasibility restored through DualSimplex)
###### Planned Features:
  * Friendly gui for easy selection of food items
  * User-inputted constraints
  * Custom nutrition data input from the user
###### Screenshots:
TBD
