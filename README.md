# FoodCalc---Java
## Optimizes diet using linear programming


###### Idea:

###### Features:
  * Parses data from USDA website for over 8,000 food items and their nutritional content
  * Implements **Simplex method**
  * Implements **DualSimplex method**
  * Adds artificial and slack variables when necessary
  * Allows the addition of constraint equations (feasibility restored through DualSimplex)
###### Planned Features:
  * Friendly gui for easy selection of food items
  * User-inputted constraints
  * Custom nutrition data input from the user
  * Make the optimal solution also realistic
  * Implementation in C for manual memory management and support for multithreading
